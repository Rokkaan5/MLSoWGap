# ML-SoWGap: Machine Learning Models for Solar Wind Data Gaps
## Overview

## Required libraries
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- pandas
- scikitlearn
- pickle

## Data files
Many useful dataframes and pre-made models, including the current best-performing model, have been saved as pickle and joblib files. This saves time from re-creating the data or model everytime you need it. (For example, the current best-performing model took 13.5 hours to build; whereas unloading the joblib saved version of the model takes ~3 minutes.) 

However, the saved files are too large to store through GitHub so you will have to download these saved data files from Zenodo at the following link:[insert link](insert_link). 

To use the Jupyter notebooks in this repo correctly, you should save them to the "data" folder. 

### Necessary files
I will note that while each file is no larger than 10 GB, some are greater than 5 GB. The total size of all the files is less than 30 GB. 
However, not *all* files are required to use the repo. So, if file storage is a concern, you select which files you want to download. 

#### Bare minimum:
The only files needed to fill gaps with the current best performing model in this repo are:
- rfTH_100est_model.joblib (<10 GB)
- th_df.pkl (~10 GB)

#### Tutorial Notebooks
All Jupyter notebooks (in the *Tutorials* directory) should display all the outputs generated by each code cell when you open the notebook, so you can see all outputs even without excuting any of the cells. But if you would explore the code and use the data, you will want to run all or parts of the notebook and that is when the other data files are necessary. Each notebook will list all of the data files from Zenodo necessary to run the notebook.
